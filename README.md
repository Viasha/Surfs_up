# Surfs_up
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu. This analysis will be used to determine if the Surf shop is sustainable year-round. I will used my aquired skills in SQLite and Pandas to achieve this analysis.

## Results
#### June Data

* Min and Max
  * The minimum temps for June is 64 while December is 56. That is only a small 8 degree difference. This is encouraging to have a year-round store since the weather doesnt drop much colder than those reported temps. The maximum reported temps for June is 85 and 83 in Decemeber. With this small 2 degree difference it is safe to say the weather has insiginificant differences in temperature year round. 

* Mean
  * The mean temp for June is 74.9 and 71.0 for December. This is showing that even in December the average temperature is about 70 which is encouraging for a year-round surf shop. 
  
 * Standard Deviation
    *  The standard deviation for the month of June in Oahu sits at 3.3 and 3.7 in December. This low number of standard deviation signifies that the temps stay within a small range with little deviation. 
 
 ## Summary
 After reviewing all of the statistical analysis, the surf shop would be a good idea for a year round store. Since the temperatures typically stay over 70 degrees year round, the store would have success even in the colder months of the year.  
 
 ### June Precipitation

I did an additional query to check the precipitation during the months of June and December. The precipitation plays a large role in the amount of surfers also. After reviewing the statitics of the preciptation it is still a good idea to open the year round surf shop. The max amount of precipitation is 4.4 inches in June and 6.4 in December. Both of those are relatively low numbers. This small amount of precipitation is also encouraging success of the year round surf shop.
